## Documentation

#### You can find the docs at: <https://davidedantonio.github.io/bee-grid/documentation/1.0/introduction/>

Beegrid's documentation, included in this repo in the root directory, is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and publicly hosted on GitHub Pages at <https://davidedantonio.github.io/bee-grid/>. The docs may also be run locally.

### Running documentation locally

1. Install Jekyll (the site builder) and other Ruby dependencies with `bundle install`.
2. Run `npm install` to install Node.js dependencies.
3. Run a specific NPM script to rebuild distributed CSS and JavaScript files, as well as our docs assets.
4. From the root `/bee-grid` directory, run `npm run docs-serve` in the command line.
5. Open `http://localhost:9001` in your browser, and voilà.

Learn more about using Jekyll by reading its [documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/home/).
